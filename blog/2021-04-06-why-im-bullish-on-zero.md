Why I‚Äôm bullish on ZERO (0.exchange)

:::note
DISCLAIMER: This is blog post was send to us by community member $G MONEY$ it is not financial advice and please DYOR. That being said there are just so many development on this project it‚Äôs hard to keep track of it all so this post came about
:::


1. It‚Äôs likely going to be a quintadex very soon. Likely one of the first on DOT. Sure there will be other Dexs launching there, but they won‚Äôt be as developed as ZERO at the time of launch and won‚Äôt have all of the bridges from other ecosystems to bring new people‚Äôs assets in. Zero is going to be like the Manhattan of dot.  Bridges coming from everywhere trying to get into the action. That alone is enough to be super bullish.

1. IDO launchpad aka ZERO GRAVITY üòâ projects with multi chain aspirations will be able to list their projects on ZERO and have functional bridges at the time of launch. Look at the recent launches of AIOZ and BLES. Huge price disparities and no way to arbitrage between Eth and BSC. Those projects will also be listed for initial farming with a zero pair bringing in lots of new volume and TVL. Most other dex tokens are merely governance tokens. Zero will have much more utility by having to hold for IDO tiers. 

1. Added features such as pro charting, limit orders and maybe even leverage trading, insurance via bridge mutual

1. They are building their own wallet to bring all of this functionality together. To seamlessly switch between chains without having to load Custom RPCs for multiple different EVMs and mess with the different gas settings, etc. There is talk of adding 2FA to this wallet as well. 

1. ZERO is setting up a foundation. With that foundation they are going to onboard well known ‚ÄúPublic Faces‚Äù that can market the project and bring it credibility. 

1. ZERO is also going to have an NFT marketplace with aspirations of cross chain NFT transfers. Also thinking of an innovative approach with an ‚ÄúArtist in residence‚Äù feature.

1. There are plans to add a deflationary mechanism to the tokenomics. Buy back and burn is one of the proposed mechanisms, but the actual implementation is yet to be implemented. 

Thanks for reading

Is there any other DEX, Launchpad, or NFT project that offers all of that utility on one token? I don‚Äôt think so. This price action and the reasons for it are blips on the radar. You‚Äôre going to look at the charts in 6 months in linear scale and it‚Äôs going to look like price action for ants. Just freaking accumulate, farm and hodl. Let the devs build and we‚Äôll all be rewarded in the end.
