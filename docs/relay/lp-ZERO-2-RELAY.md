## Liquidity pools: Transitioning from ZERO to RELAY

### Introduction

This page will explain the impact of impact of going from a ZERO to RELAY pool, based on impermanent loss (price fluctuations), dollar value of the assets locked in the liquidity.

In summary: If you go out of the ZERO pool, exchange ZERO to RELAY quickly, and jump without waiting in a RELAY pool, you shouldn't notice any difference compared to the ZERO pool.  Then you are subjected on the RELAY price fluctuation like you are today with ZERO, and normal impermanet loss applies.


### Simulation

Calculations are based on the website https://safe.defiyield.app/advanced-impermanent-loss-calculator  

Figures/values of tokens are not real: Rounded and easy numbers were used (which are close to the real values) in order to make the explanation as simple as possible.

\(*) $RELAY liquidity providers will get a share of the bridge volume transactions paid in the native gas token of the chains (ETH, BNB, AVAX, MATIC, HT, etc).  This allows a passive income based on your share of the $RELAY tokens.

Which proportions of the bridge fees will be allocated to which part, still to be disclosed by the team.
