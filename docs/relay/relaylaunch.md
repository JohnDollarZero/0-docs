## The relay chain ecosystem

In light of the project evolution from its launch at the end of January 2021 and during the course of the first half of 2021, and in order to counter some issues which were affecting the ZERO token monetary value, and to widen the adoption of its cross chain bridge, the Zero team has decided to capitalize on their main asset: The ZeroBridge, together with a new form of tokenomics centered around the bridge fees. 

Other parts of the existing Zero exchange features, like being a multi chain DEX, launchpad, liquidity mining will remain, but the main focus since the team's decision to pivot the project has been and will be on the bridge:
-	Continuing to add more chains : HECO, Cosmos, Fantom, Solona, and Near (Aurora)
-	Create earning opportunities for investors based on the bridge transactions, and not just purely on traditional DEX or liquidity mining operations
-	Forge partnerships with major partners (parent chains and liquidity providers)
-	Made it basically bulletproof and much more resilient to occasional chain/network issues like congestion (typically affecting BSC and Polygon at times)
-	Fast transfer
-	Continue with the Gas Token Airdrop for being able to do a few trades on the destination chain

### The $RELAY token

In order to realise the new direction, a new token will be minted, $RELAY, which will replace the $ZERO token with a different tokenomic.  $ZERO token holders will be able to claim $RELAY tokens in exchange for their $ZERO tokens on a 100:1 $ZERO:$RELAY ratio, regardless of the price of $ZERO or $RELAY at the time of the claim.

Initially, the only way to acquire $RELAY tokens is by exchanging from $ZERO tokens.

How and when still to be announced.

Long term holders of the $ZERO token will be also rewarded for their loyality: The how and when, still to be announced


### Tokenomics

Please note that this is based on informal information given by the team in Telegram channels, official news and explanations not yet out .

Supply: 10 millions tokens  
Initial price: $ZERO price multiplied by 100  
Initial marketcap: Same as $ZERO  

__How the bridge fees will be used:__

\(*) $RELAY liquidity providers will get a share of the bridge volume transactions paid in the native gas token of the chains (ETH, BNB, AVAX, MATIC, HT, etc).  This allows a passive income based on your share of the $RELAY tokens.

Which proportions of the bridge fees will be allocated to which part, still to be disclosed by the team.
