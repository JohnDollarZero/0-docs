## ZeroGravity Launchpad

The Zero Exchange has its own launchpad [ZeroGravity](https://medium.com/@OfficialZeroDex/introducing-the-zerogravity-launchpad-61fd8f751918):
	  
* Allows great flexibility for the projects to choose the chain(s) they want to launch their token on (+ feature of cross chaining if on several chains)
* Sometimes, an IDO may require a KYC ("Know Your Customer"):
	* Either to make it to the whitelist to be able to participate in an IDO (=> being allowed or not to participate in the lottery system)
	* Either for an allocation winner to be able to claim the allocation
* The Zero exchange has found a way for citizens from barred countries to still benefit these IDOs ((typically, US or Canadian citizens for example). An automated market maker sells during a period of the time the allocation of the winners who didn't pass the KYC, after which, tthey receive their share of the benefits in a stable coin without ever having received the IDO tokens.
 
  
## IDOs on ZeroGravity

## IDO participation and allocations

### How to qualify for an IDO?

* ByÂ holding Zero in your wallet
* Being in liquidity pools, some LP provide multipliers for the lottery tickets calculation. 

:::tip
It doesn't matter on which chain you are holding Zero or being in liquidity pools, the Zero exchange will compound per wallet all your assets across the chains to determine your tier level and the number of lottery tickets you earn.

### How to win an IDO allocation
      
Depending on the IDO:

* The tier system is not taking into account and just holding a minimum of Zero as required by that particular IDO is enough to be able to participate
* The tier system is applied to win an allocation. Depending on the IDO, one or more allocations can be won per wallet.
	* The tier requirements may vary per IDO (although there is a general guide line so far)
* In function of your tier level:  
	* You get a guaranteed allocation or not
	* You enter a lottery with a number of tickets calculated by the system (check the information further down)
		* Lottery tickets is combined with the guaranteed allocation: You can still make a chance to win more allocations than the guaranteed one(s).
		* A fair and unbiased chance of winning an allocation thanks to the integration of a decentralized service available through the Chainlink Network, [Chainlink Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF)](https://medium.com/@OfficialZeroDex/integrating-chainlink-vrf-to-secure-fair-distribution-of-zerogravity-ido-allocations-b839e6a0c594)

### Overview tier levels and lottery tickets system
      
#### Tier levels:
      
1. "Nebula"  
	** Holding minimum 5000 ZERO **
      
1. "Red Giant": Guaranteed allocation  
	** Holding mininum 500.000 ZERO or equivalent in liquidity pools **
      
1. "Super Nova": Several guaranteed allocations  
	** Holding 1 million ZERO or equivalent in liquidity pools **

#### Basic principles for the number of tickets calculation
      
* Each 5k zero gives one ticket for the lottery
* Each 25k zero gives one xtra bonus ticket
* Number of tickets calculated capped to 500k zero

To check your tier level and number of tickets you will earn for the lottery at this [online calculator](http://csb-z8u0x.netlify.app)

:::note
You have to input manually the number of Zero you hold, there is not a calculation yet based on the LP tokens.
:::

#### Participation in liquidity pools for ticket calculation
      
Some liquidity pools benefit from a 2x multiplier

:::note      
Please check the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@OfficialZeroDex/introducing-the-zerogravity-launchpad-61fd8f751918) for the eligible liquidity pools and LP token values for the calculation
