## Zero Gravity Launchpad

The Zero Exchange has its own launchpad, [Zero Gravity](https://medium.com/@OfficialZeroDex/introducing-the-zerogravity-launchpad-61fd8f751918)
	  
1. Allows great flexibility for the projects to choose the chain they want to launch their token on
1. Sometimes, an IDO way require a KYC ("Know Your Customer") to make it to the whitelist to be able to participate in an IDO (typically, US or Canadian citizens are barred from entering such IDOs).  
1. The Zero exchange has found a way for citizens from barred countries to still benefit these IDOs. An automated market maker sells the allocation of the winners, who in turn will receive their share of the benefits without ever having received the IDO tokens.

## Planned IDOs on Zero Zero Gravity

1. Date TBC, 2021: SENT (not started)
1. May 19th, 2021: GROW (snapshots started)
1. May 10th, 2021: WISB (finished)
1. May 07th, 2021: Wasder (finished)

## How to qualify for an IDO?

1. ByÂ holding Zero in your wallet
1. Being in liquidity pools, some LP provide multipliers for the lottery tickets calculation. 

:::tip
It doesn't matter on which chain you are holding Zero or being in liquidity pools, the Zero exchange will compound per wallet all your assets across the chains to determine your tier level and the number of lottery tickets you earn.

## How to win an IDO allocation
      
Depending on the IDO:

1. The tier system is not taking into account and just holding a minimum of Zero as required by that particular IDO is enough to be able to participate
1. The tier system is applied to win an allocation. Depending on the IDO, one or more allocations can be won per wallet.
1. In function of your tier level:
	1. You have a guaranteed allocation
    1. You enter a lottery with a number of tickets calculated by the system (see the information in "Tiers")
    1. The two are combined for the higher tiers: You have at least a guaranteed allocation and you enter the lottery to make a chance to earn more than one allocation.
