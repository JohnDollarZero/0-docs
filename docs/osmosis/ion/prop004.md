# The Commonwealth of Ion

Holders of OSMO,

The Republic of Osmosis is flourishing! We happy few are witnesses to the joining together of the Cosmos chains here at the dawn of the Internet of Blockchains. 
We the ION holders greet our elder siblings. Born in the same genesis as OSMO, ION was the unexpected twin, fairdropped by a mysterious, unknown mechanism, and later bought up more widely by those who believed in the memetic powers of ION, and in the collective power of the Osmosis braintrust.
ION is a purposefully blank slate, and Sunny has encouraged us the ION community to develop a use for it. We have been brewing many radical ideas for ION, which you will soon see, or which you can come help develop in the forums.


OSMO holders, we propose to you that ION is a commonwealth within the borders of Osmosis. We share the same chain, the same security, and the same founders, and we hope and strive for the success of OSMO and ION alike.
While we recognize Osmosis as the sovereign chain, we cannot thrive without some degree of independence. We must be free to decide some matters for ourselves. 
Indeed, without the protection of self-governance, ION risks falling into disuse and losing its memetic appeal. This would harm all Osmosis.

Therefore, we the ION holders are asking to enshrine the following rights of self-determination to benefit all Osmosians:
1. the right for ION holders to decide the tokenomics of ION 
1. the right to give ION use cases and to govern these ourselves
1. the right to develop a separate treasury out of our own funds and to govern that treasury
1. and any similar rights consistent with a self-sufficient ION DAO that does not infringe on OSMO holders' prerogatives

We are emphatically NOT asking for the right to control any Osmosis funds. If we have a proposed use case involving OSMO-controlled funds, we will use our self-governance to draw up a proposal for OSMO holders to decide upon.


As Osmosis develops, we expect to see ION and OSMO holders working in tandem to add utility and wealth to the chain as a whole. Delegating to us the right to control our destiny within Osmosis without a means for ION to usurp OSMO or vice versa, aligns the interests of us all.
ION will have a symbiotic relationship with OSMO, drawing eyeballs and liquidity to Osmosis, and sharing its memetic velocity with the entire chain.
With your support, the commonwealth of Ionia is prepared to build something great for Osmosis and the Cosmos as a whole.
