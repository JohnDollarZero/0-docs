:::caution
Usual disclaimers: We are not financial advisors, the methods explained on this page are not guaranteed to net you a benefit, it describes some of the opportunities on the Zero Exchange platform to earn more.
:::

## Introduction

With the Zero platform, there are several ways to earn more without investing more than your initial investment, and you don't need to be a whale with bazillion zero tokens to generate more gains.

Three possible strategies with your current ZERO asset without investing more capital:
* Hold your bag of ZERO, wait for it to rise and sell for a profit  
* Try to gain more Zero with scalping: Trade often by buying low and selling high
* Farm ZERO by entering one or more liquidity pools


## Trading

Do the traditional "buy low, sell high" routine, with ZERO or other tokens available to trade on the exchange:
* On the Ethereum chain: The available tokens are exactly the same as the ones on Uniswap.Â  You can use replace Uniswap entirely with the Zero Exchange.
* On BSC and Avalanche: Limited to tokens supported by the Zero Exchange

Trading fees on the chains from lowest to highest: BSC > Avalanche > Ethereum

**Risks:**
* Price fluctuations: You can't buy back lower than what you sold for.
* When trading on the Ethereum network: Transaction fee.  You may want to offset the transaction fees costs with a big enough value of the trade to make it worth


## Farming/providing liquidity

As a DEX, one of the primary function is to have and to generate enough liquidity for trading operations and other features requiring the ZERO token.

You can enter a liquidity pool to farm ZERO tokens for the Exchange, and you are rewarded in return with ZERO tokens:
* Liquidity pools are paired tokens in a pool: Provide a pair of tokens with equivalent dollar value of each at the time of entering the pool.  Most liquid pools on the Zero Exchange are paired with ZERO, as to generate ZERO tokens that you collect as rewards. Rewards are earned as soon as you enter and stop once you exit: The longer you stay, the more you earn.
* A liquidity pool is subjected to a contract: Which paired tokens, When it starts, when it stops, how much tokens of one of the pair are farmed per week.  When you enter a pool, you have a share of the pool, because others are also in the pool.  Your share will depend on how dollar value your share is worth, compared to the total dollar value entered.
* On the Zero Exchange, there are many pools to chose from on the different chains, with various levels of APY returns.
* Zero is partnered with other projects, with liquidity pools with Zero as pair per farming the other paired token (like Gondola Finance or ChartEx for example)
* Entering/exiting pools are subjected to fees paid in the native token of the chain like for a normal trade. As usual, from the cheapest to the more expensive: BSC > Avalanche > Ethereum


What to do with the rewards:

* Harvest them and accumulate in your wallet
* Compound in the same pool: Harvest them, swap half of them to the other paired token, and add more liquidity (> to raise your share of the pool to earn more rewards in the same time frame)
* Sell your rewards to another token/stable coin like USDT for profits

## "Arbing" between chains

Since the exchange is connecting several chains and trading is done on the different chains, there are often temporary price differences between chains for a same token.  The prices stabilises by people buying/selling on different chains to take advantage of the differences.

Arbing between chains involves the traditional trading, but you add the cross chain feature as well.

_An example of arbing with the Zero token:_
Price of Zero on the BSC chain: 35c
Price of Zero on the Avalanche chain: 33c

High level steps:
* On BSC chain: Swap ZERO to USDT

* Cross chain USDT to the Avalanche chain

* On Avanlanche chain: Swap USDT to ZERO

=> Now you have more Zero for the same capital ðŸ™‚

=> And then continue these operations back and forth between the different chains

To make it worth: You have to do it with rather big volumes to offset the bridge costs

**Risks:** That the cheaper price on the chain you targeted changes during your action and is not low enough to make it a profitable trade anymore
