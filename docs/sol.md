## Getting started

Before you YETH all your coins at the market we are going to take you through a few steps so that your attempt to make your wife's boyfriend jealous is successful and you can enjoy copious amounts of coins of your own.
As with all these new chains that are still in heavy development it's important you proceed at your own risk.

To get started on SOLANA you are going to need a few tools and links. 

1. Setup a seed with the [sollet.io web wallet](https://sollet.io/) 
1. Backup your sollet wallet seed into your cold storage books (PLEASE DONT SKIP THIS STEP PLEB)
1. Add tokens to Sollet that you want to hold. For sure at least ROPE and USDC.
1. Go to Binance or your exchange of choice and buy SOL
1. Send the SOL from your CEX (CEntral eXchange) to your sollet wallet by finding your sollet receive address and pasting that as the withdrawal address at your CEX.
