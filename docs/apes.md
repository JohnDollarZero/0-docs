## Getting started

Nonfungible apes is an NFT project with a twist. Your apes can be paired together into APE families and staked to make APE babies and earn rewards. Sounds interesting and like no other NFT's you own doesn't it?

To get started with nonfungible apes you will need a few tools and links. 

1. Go to [nonfungibleapes.wtf](https://nonfungibleapes.wtf) to read up on whats new
1. Now head over to [opensea to buy your first APE.](https://opensea.io/collection/nonfungibleapes)
1. Make sure you purchase a male and a female APE so you will be able to stake
1. More to come as details are released in the next few weeks.
