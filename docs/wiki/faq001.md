# Which wallet to use?

The ideal wallet is one which can add/support a multitude of chains, so all the assets are centralised in one wallet even when Zero adds more chains in the future:

* MetaMask is the top recommended one:
** is already the "go to" wallet when interacting with decentralised exchange
** The team is trying to smooth as much as possible the interactions between MetaMask and the Zero Exchange (like the automatic chain switching feature for example)
** Regardless on which chains you have assets, you have one single MetaMask address (there is not a different address by chain)

MetaMask can be used either as an extension to your browser, either as a mobile app.

* To install MetaMask starting from the Zero Exchange, check the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UABV0xzYAEg)

** Make sure that you install/download the legit MetaMask extension/app, crypto is full of scammers.  If it's not a legit MetaMask, you could risk losing all your assets. **
