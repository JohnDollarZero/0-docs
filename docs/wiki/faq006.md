# Tokens traded on the Zero Exchange can be traded on other exchanges as well?

It depends on which chain and/or which token.

On the Ethereum chain:
* Yes for all tokens. When trading on the ETH chain, you replace Uniswap (or other DEXes) by the Zero Exchange instead


On the Avalanche chain:
* The native Avax token can be traded on any exchanges on the Avax chain
* There is a partnership with Gondola Finance, which will allow in the future to swap some tokens between exchanges on the Avax chain.  For example, send USDT from the Zero exchange to the Pangolin exchange. Instead of selling the zUSDT to Avax on the Zero Exchange, then go to Pangolin and sell the Avax to their USDT token.


* On the BSC chain:
* Same story as for Avax chain
* Gondola Finance is for the moment only existing on the Avalanche chain
* The native BNB token can be traded on any exchanges on the BSC chain (like Pancakeswap for example)
