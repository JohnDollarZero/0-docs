      1. What is the Zero Exchange?

      The Zero Exchange is at its core a multi and cross chain decentralized exchange.  Its ethos are to fully embrace the decentralized aspects of crypto and to grow a thriving and engaged community, backed by a dedicated project team identifying the opportunities (features, technical, partnerships, etc) to build as a 1st mover a model for the future of crypto trading on multiple chains in a one stop shop, except that the future is now.


      1. Official statement from the white paper

      "ZERO Exchange is a fully decentralised protocol for automated liquidity provision.

      The ZERO Exchange Protocol realigns incentives for network participants by introducing revenue sharing and community driven network effects to the popular AMM model."

  <TabItem value="fees">
      How much are the trading fees and is it really zero fee?

      The fees depends on which chain the trade is done: Very low on BSC, a bit more expensive on AVAX than on BSC, ETH is the most expensive (same fees as Uniswap).

      Compared to the ETH chain, the trading fees are almost zero on BSC and AVAX.

      How much are the cross chain/bridging fees?

      Fixed fee of around 2.99 AVAX regardless of the chains being bridged.

      Why so high even when crossing from BSC to AVAX for example where fees are cheap?
      For equality reason between bridge users, the bridge costs are spread evenly amongst all bridged chains: Once more chains are integrated, fees will go lower because the costs can be spread even more.


      Gas tokens for the trading fees

      Depending on which chain you are trading on, you need the native token of the chain to pay for the transactions fees:

      * On the Ethereum chain, you need ETH
	  
      * On the BSC chain, you need BNB
	  
      * On the Avalanche chain, you need AVAX
	  

      Our experience is that for people new in crypto, getting hold of AVAX in MetaMask starting from a centralised exchange like Binance, can be a bit daunting (there are tutorials available).  The Zero Exchange has foreseen a goodie for the bridge users: When you do a cross chain for the first time, you will receive a portion of BNB or AVAX (depending on which chain you cross to) for a few trades on the crossed chain.  To be safe, convert then a part of your crossed chain tokens to BNB or AVAX as to have a reserve to pay for more transaction fees.

  <TabItem value="team">
      Who is the team?
      
	  Team is anonymous for the following reasons they have stated:

      * Their team members are working for top crypto projects and have NDA's in place (so could risk losing benefits if they are identified as working for a competing project).
	  
      * As for a lot of crypto projects, this one is also very open to the community.  The team lead for example is on Telegram almost every day discussing with the community in various channels: Revealing their identities could jeopardise their private life.
	  

      It's not uncommon in crypto for legit projects that the team are anonymous.

      With that said, the team being anonymous is not an issue and that statement can be very strongly backed by the community.  Since the launch of the project, team has proven to be very agile and delivered more than anticipated, important partnerships have already been concluded with known players in the crypto space (who wouldn't touch an anon team project if they had estimated they were not legit).
	  Nobody has ever lost funds when some bridge transactions were occasionally stuck (dev team has to manually push the transactions), a lot of volume has already been reached and funds have never disappeared.
	  The team has 100% the trust of the community, we invite you to join the Telegram groups if you have any doubts, we can guarantee that the positive reactions will overwhelm you.
	  
	  Code/contracts have been audited by Zokyo and the report is available at.
