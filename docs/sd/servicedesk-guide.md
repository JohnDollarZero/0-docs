## Introduction

This page describes how to use the ticketing system:
* Type of tickets
* Edition of ticket states
* Manage ticket queues


## 1. Ticket types and workflow 

### 1.1 Ticket types and categories

There are 4 types of tickets configured and grouped under two categories.  Each ticket has its specific fields (mandatory or optional) to be filled in by the user.  
The user has to fill in an email address to be able to register the ticket: System doesn't check if it's a fake one or not, ticket will be registered anyway.  

**Category "Incidents":**  
* Stuck transaction
* Bug report

Grouped under "Incidents" for the service desk agent (customer sees "Issue or bug registration").
 
**Category "Changes":**
* UI improvement
* Feature suggestion

Grouped under "Changes" for the service desk agent (customer sees "Improvement or feature suggestion").

*I'm using a free plan for this software, it seems I can't delete the other categories imposed on the interface, nor rename any of them to anything else.*
