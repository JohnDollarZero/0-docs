## Ticket types and workflow 

### Ticket types and categories![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84021567/123236075-c2248900-d4dc-11eb-8cac-eccc1392e807.png)


There are 4 types of tickets grouped under two categories.  Each ticket has its specific fields (mandatory or optional) to be filled in by the user.
The user has to fill in an email address to be able to register the ticket: System doesn't check if it's a fake one or not, ticket will be registered anyway.
