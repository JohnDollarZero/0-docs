## Registration of a stuck transaction after a cross chain

:::caution
In the ticketing system, we will never ask to connect your wallet or communicate your wallet seed phrase.  Beware of scammers who may set up a fake website looking like ours and trying to make you connect your wallet or get your seed phrase.
:::

:::caution
In the Telegram chat, no mod/admin will ever message you first if you need help, we will ask you to message us first if needed. 
:::

:::tip
In the case of a stuck transaction, your funds are 100% safe!  No one has ever lost anything during a cross chain operation on this project.  
The bridge is operational since the last week of January 2021, started with an Ethereum-Avalanche chains with more added gradually, not a single instance of permanently lost funds has been reported.

### A few checks before creating the ticket
* A transfer can take between a few minutes up to 15 minutes in normal conditions (regardless of the token being cross chained, there is no difference in processing speed between a ZERO token or another).  
Some cases of waiting occasionally up to an hour have been reported if the origin or destination chains are suffering temporary lags due to technical issues unrelated to the bridge of the exchange (typically affects more BSC and Polygon once in a while than the other chains, they can be sometimes congested).
* Have you checked that when you switch to the destination chain on the Zero Exchange interface, the cross-chained tokens appears on the Zero Exchange interface on the swap page? (even if you have not added the token address in MetaMask, they should appear there once they have successfully been transferred from one chain to the other)

* Don't confuse a stuck transaction with a failed transfer initiation on the origin network: Did you have enough tokens for the gas fees or you use the correct gas settings in MetaMask (especially when Ethereum is the origin chain)

### Registration of the ticket
If after one hour, you still have not received your tokens on the destination chain, you can open a ticket on https://0exchange.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals

#### Transaction details/ID of the transfer to communicate in the ticket
* The details/ID of the transaction of the cross chain will be asked in the ticket (from the origin chain), ideally with an url from a network scan tool such as:
  * BSC: https://bscscan.com
  * Avalanche: https://cchain.explorer.avax.network
  * Polygon: https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com
  * Ethereum: https://etherscan.io

#### Resolution process and time
Process:
* A member of the dev team will manually solve the stuck transaction through the bridge
  * Between Monday and Thursday, it may take up to 24h between the creation of the ticket and its resolution
  * If ticket created between Friday and Sunday: Depends on what time it has been created related to when the dev team works, you may have to wait until the next Monday (US time zone)
* In 99.999% of the cases, you will receive the tokens on the destination chain as intended.  For a few exceptionnal cases, the funds were returned on the origin chain
* We will not inform you immediately by mail or on Telegram with a message to your Telegram handle that the stuck transaction has been solved.
  * You will found out by yourself that the issue has been resolved
