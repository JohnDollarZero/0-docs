## Registration of stuck transaction after a cross chain

:::tip
In the ticketing system, we will never ask to connect your wallet or communicate your wallet seed phrase.  Beware of scammers who may set up a fake website looking like ours and trying to make you connect your wallet or get your seed phrase.

In the Telegram chat, no mod/admin will ever message you first if you need help, we will ask you to message us first if needed.

In the case of a stuck transaction, your funds are safe!  No one has ever lost anything during a cross chain operation.  For info, the bridge is operational since the last week of January 2021, started with an Ethereum-Avalanche chains and with more added gradually.

### A few checks before creating the ticket
* A transfer can take between a few minutes up to 15 minutes in normal conditions (regardless of the token being cross chained, there is no difference in processing speed between a ZERO token or another).  Some cases of waiting occasionally up to an hour have been reported, if the origin or destination chains are suffering temporary lags due to technical issues unrelated to the bridge of the exchange (typically affects more BSC and Polygon once in a while than the other chains, they can be sometimes congested).
* Have you checked that when you switch to the destination chain on the Zero Exchange interface, the cross-chained tokens appears on the Zero Exchange interface on the swap page? (even if you have not added the token address in MetaMask, they should appear there once they have successfully been transferred from one chain to the other)

* Don't confuse a stuck transaction with a failed transfer on the origin network: Did you have enough tokens for the gas fees or you use the correct gas settings in MetaMask (especially when Ethereum is the origin chain)

### Registration of the ticket
If after one hour, you still have not received your tokens on the destination chain, you can open a ticket on https://0exchange.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals

#### Transaction details/ID of the transfer to communicate in the ticket
* The details/ID of the transaction of the cross chain will be asked in the ticket (from the origin chain), ideally with an url from a network scan tool such as:
  * BSC: https://bscscan.com
  * Avalanche: https://cchain.explorer.avax.network
  * Polygon: https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com
  * Ethereum: https://etherscan.io

#### Resolution process/time
Process:
* A member of the dev team will push manually the transaction through the bridge
