## Registration of stuck transaction after a cross chain

:::tip
In the ticketing system, we will never ask to connect your wallet or communicate your wallet seed phrase.  Beware of scammers who may set up a fake website looking like our ticketing system and trying to make you connect your wallet or get your seed phrase.

### A few checks before creating the ticket
* A normal cross chain can take between a few minutes up to 15 minutes (regardless of the token being cross chained, there is no difference in processing speed between a ZERO token or another).  Some cases of waiting between 20 minutes up to an hour have been reported, if the origin or destination chains have temporary lags due to network congestion (typically affects more BSC and Polygon once in a while than the other chains).
* Have you checked that when you switch to the destination chain on the Zero Exchange interface, the cross-chained tokens appears on the Zero Exchange interface on the swap page? (even if you have not added the token address in MetaMask, they should appear there once they have successfully been transferred from one chain to the other)

#### Transaction details/ID of the transfer to communicate in the ticket
* The details/ID of the transaction of the cross chain will be asked in the ticket (from the origin chain), ideally with an url from a network scan tool such as:
  * BSC: https://bscscan.com
  * Avalanche: https://cchain.explorer.avax.network
  * Polygon: https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com
  * Ethereum: https://etherscan.io
