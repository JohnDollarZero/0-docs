### Stuck transaction after a cross chain

Before creating the ticket:
* Have you checked that when you switch to the destination chain on the Zero Exchange interface, the tokens appears on the Zero Exchange interface on the swap page for example? (even if you have not added the token address in MetaMask, they should appear there)
* Have you tried to cross chain more than an hour ago?
