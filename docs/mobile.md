# Getting started

First of all if this is your first APE into the world of crypto welcome! Before you YETH all your coins at the 
market we are going to take you through a few steps so that your attempt to make your wife's boyfriend jealous 
is successful and you can enjoy copious amounts of coins of your own.

To get started on MOBILE you are going to need a few tools and links to get you started. 

1. Download Trust Wallet from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/trust-crypto-bitcoin-wallet/id1288339409) or [PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wallet.crypto.trustapp)
1. Backup your trust wallet seed into your cold storage books
1. Add tokens to Trust Wallet (TW) that you want to hold. For sure at least Smart Chain (BNB) and BUSD (BEP20).
1. iOS Users need to [re-enable the browser inside of trust wallet](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/enable-dapp-browser-on-trust-wallet-ios-version/98308)
1. Go to Binance or your exchange of choice and buy BNB
1. If you are in the US the BNB you get from Binance will be BEP2 not BEP20 (Smart Chain) BNB so we will need to use the built in Trust Wallet dex to exchange it from BEP2 to BEP20
1. If you aren't in the US Binance will ask you if you want BEP2 BNB or BEP20 BNB for using on Smart Chain we need BEP20


## Screen Shots
Enable the Browser as mentioned above in step 4

At the top select the network you want to use for example Smart Chain
