# ZeroBridge

The brigde enables to cross tokens from one chain to the other, bridge is connected to these chains:
* Currently:  
  * Ethereum
  * Avalanche
  * BSC
  * Polygon (Matic)
* Done, waiting for the parachains to go live:  
  * Kusama/DOT


## Which tokens can be cross chained?

* ZERO, as it is native and connected to all chains
* For the tokens, it will depends on their availabilities on both pair of chains selected to cross chain

## How to cross chain?

Digital Asset News did a specific video on the Zero Exchange and the team showed how to cross chain: [How to cross chain](https://youtu.be/lGVNDuotddM?t=1164)


## Cross chain/bridging fees

Fees depends on which chain tokens are bridged from:
* From Polygon to another chain: 1$
* From BSC to another chain: 5$
* From Avax to another chain: 15$
* From Ethereum to another chain: More than 100$


### MetaMask gas settings
When cross chaining, it's important to set the correct gas settings (especially when crossing from the Ethereum chain): Check the settings in this [gas settings guide](https://0-exchange.gitbook.io/0-exchange-docs/pinned/transaction-fails)
