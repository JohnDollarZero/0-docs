# For the IDO allocations, does it matter on which chain I hold my Zero tokens/provide liquidity?

No, you can hold Zero on multiple chains.

It doesn't matter on which chain you are holding Zero or being in liquidity pools, the Zero exchange will compound per wallet all your assets across the chains to determine your tier level and the number of lottery tickets you earn.
