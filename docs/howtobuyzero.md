## How to buy the ZERO token

1. On the Zero Exchange itself on different chains:
	* On Ethereum
	* On Binance Smart Chain (= "BSC" in short)
	* On Avalanche
	* On Polygon
	  
2. With a credit card (note: not all countries are yet allowed to buy via a credit card)
	  
3. On Centralised exchanges (CEX):
	* On [Bithumb Global](https://www.bithumb.pro/en-us)
	  
:::note
**The ZERO bought on Bithumb is on the Ethereum chain** and the ERC20 tokens can be sent to your wallet on the Ethereum network

## Buying ZERO on the Zero Exchange

Assumptions:
* Most of the options described are based on using the MetaMask wallet: Check this [Zero DeFi Academy youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/UABV0xzYAEg)
* Some of the options may work with other wallets as well, like Trust Wallet
* You know how to send tokens from a centralised exchange to MetaMask or use the Web Avalanche Wallet (explained in [this FAQ](faq/faq016.md)
* You know how to add a new token in the token lists of your wallet


Buy options from the cheapest to the more expensive chain/method:
1. Buy on the Polygon chain
1. Buy on the BSC chain
1. Buy on the Avalanche chain
1. Buy on the Ethereum chain
1. Buy with a credit card

### On the Polygon chain

1. Buy MATIC on a centralised exchange, like Binance or Ascendex
1. Send MATIC to MetaMask
1. On the Zero Exchange, connect your wallet and switch to the Polygon chain
1. On the swap page, trade MATIC for ZERO


### On the Avalanche chain

1. Buy AVAX on a centralised exchange, like Binance or OKex
1. Send AVAX to the Web Avalanche Wallet and then to MetaMask: [Check this FAQ](faq/faq016.md)
3. On the Zero Exchange, connect your wallet and switch to the Avalanche chain
4. On the swap page, trade AVAX for ZERO

### On the BSC chain

Check this [Zero DeFi Academy youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77B7vfFtxq4)

1. Buy BNB on Binance
1. From Binance, withdraw/send it to the MetaMask wallet on the BEP20 network
1. On the Zero Exchange, have your wallet connected and switch to the Smart Chain
1. On the swap page, trade BNB for Zero

:::note
**Don't use Pancakeswap** to buy ZERO on the BSC chain
:::
	  
Note: Don't confuse the BSC network with the Binance website which is the trading centralized platform running on its own and is not connected to the BSC network.  
Binance created the BSC network as a separate decentralized network, although they are still in full control of it.
	  
### On the Ethereum chain
	  
1. Buy ETH on a centralised exchange
1. Send ETH to MetaMask on the ERC20 network
1. In MetaMask, switch manually to the Ethereum network.  On the Zero Exchange, we can't switch automatically to Ethereum network in Metamask like for the other chains
1. On the swap page, trade ETH for ZERO
	  
### With a Credit Card
