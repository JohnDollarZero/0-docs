# How can I buy BNB?

Centralised Exchanges:
* Binance:
** [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en)
** [Binance US](https://www.binance.us/en/home)
* It's very straight forward to send to MetaMask (see other FAQ)


From Kucoin:

* [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/)
* Less straight forward to send to MetaMask than when buying on Binance directly

** BNB from Kucoin must be sent to the Trust Wallet on the BEP2 network

** In Trust Wallet, on the BNB tab hit the three dots and chooose "Swap to Smart Chain" to swap the BNB from the BEP2 to the BEP20 network

** Send BNB to MetaMask
