## How can I buy BNB?

Centralised Exchanges:

1. Binance:

	1. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en)
	1. [Binance US](https://www.binance.us/en/home)
	1. It's very straight forward to send to MetaMask (see other FAQ about that subject)

1. From Kucoin:

	1. [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/)
	1. Less straight forward to send to MetaMask than when buying on Binance directly

:::tip
** BNB from Kucoin must be sent to the Trust Wallet on the BEP2 network **
:::

:::tip
** In Trust Wallet, on the BNB tab hit the three dots and chooose "Swap to Smart Chain" to swap the BNB from the BEP2 to the BEP20 network. Then send the BEP20 BNB to MetaMask **
