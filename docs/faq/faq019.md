## Entering a liquidity pool

[Check this faq](faq009.md) on how to manage your liquidity pools.

## Steps

:::Note
For the steps where an action is required in MetaMask (> confirm/sign a transaction), the next step may be slow or quick depending on the chain where you are providing liquidity (Ethereum is usually much slower than the other chains), just be patient until the system displays the next screen.
:::  

1. Make sure your wallet is connected to the Zero Exchange 
1. Select the chain and then the pool you want to enter.  In our example, we will enter the pool ZERO-AVAX on the Avalanche chain

1. Click on the "Select" button after selecting the liquidity pool

1. You will arrive on the ZERO/AVAX liquidity pool management screen.  Click on the "Add Liquidity" button  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq019-003.png')} />

1. In the "Add liquidity" screen, select how much ZERO or AVAX you want to provide: The system will automatically calculate and display how much of the other pair will be provided 
:::Note
When you are providing liquidity with the token also used for transaction fees (like AVAX on the Avalanche chain), don't max out your total amount of that token from your wallet, keep some for future transactions
