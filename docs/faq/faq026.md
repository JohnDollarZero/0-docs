## No liquidity to swap "zXXX" tokens after a cross chain

After cross chain chaining a token, you end up with the wrapped "z" token on the destination chain, but you are unable to trade it because there is no liquidity for it on the destination chain (check this FAQ about [What are wrapped zXXX tokens](faq005.md)).

### Solution:
* Cross the z tokens back to the chain you came from
* Follow the steps from this FAQ: [Sending stable coins from one chain to another](faq006.md)
