## How often should I harvest the rewards of a liquidity pools?

Parameters to take account of:

1. It costs fee to harvest rewards.  From the cheapest to most expensive chain to claim your rewards: BSC > Avalanche > Ethereum
1. How much ZERO in value you are harvesting vs fee to harvest
1. What you want to do with the rewards:

** Harvest them and accumulate in your wallet **

** Compound in the same pool: Harvest them, swap half of them to the other paired token, and add more liquidity (> to raise your share of the pool to earn more rewards in the same time frame) **

** Sell your rewards to another token/stable coin like USDT/USDC for profits **
