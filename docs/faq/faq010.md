## How often should I claim the rewards of a liquidity pools?

Parameters to take account of:

* It costs transaction fees to claim rewards.  From the cheapest to the most expensive chain to claim your rewards: Polygon > BSC > Avalanche > Ethereum
* How much ZERO in value you are claiming vs fees to claim
* What you want to do with the rewards:  
  * Claim to accumulate/hold in your wallet
  * Compound back in the same pool: Claim them, swap half of them to the other paired token, and add more liquidity (> to raise your share of the pool to earn more rewards)
  * Sell your rewards to another token/stable coin like USDT for profits
