## How can I send AVAX from Binance/Okex to Metamask?

Follow this [Zero DeFi Academy Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNGqS-X4ruM)

Steps:
1. Create a new web Avalanche wallet or log into it at [Web Avalanche Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network/)  

1. From Binance/OKex, withdraw AVAX to the X-chain address from the Web Avalanche Wallet: This process is slow, it can take from several minutes to several hours before the AVAX tokens are received in the Avalanche Web Wallet

1. Once the AVAX is received from the Binance/OKex, you can see the AVAX balance in the wallet on the X-chain

1. Cross chain from the X-chain: Click on "Cross Chain", set Source Chain to "X Chain", set Destination Chain set to "C Chain", set the amount to transfer, and click on "Transfer"

Binance has sometimes a habit of disabling temporarily the withdrawal of some tokens, like AVAX:

1. In that case, you can send USDT from Binance to OKex on the TRC20 network, it's free and fast
1. Buy AVAX on OKex with the received USDT
