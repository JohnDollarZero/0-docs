## How can I send AVAX from Binance/Okex to Metamask?

Follow this [Zero DeFi Academy Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNGqS-X4ruM)

Steps:

1. Send AVAX to the [Web Avalanche Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network/)
	* AVAX must be withdrawn from Binance on the X-chain address from the Web Avalanche Wallet: This process is slow, it can take from several minutes to several hours before the AVAX tokens are received in the Avalanche Web Wallet
1. Inside the Web Avalanche Wallet, cross chain the AVAX from the X-chain to the C-chain
1. Send the AVAX from the Web Avalanche Wallet to MetaMask
1. On the Zero Exchange, have your wallet connected and switch to the Avalanche chain
1. On the swap page, trade AVAX for Zero
  
  
Binance has sometimes a habit of disabling temporarily the withdrawal of some tokens, like AVAX:

1. In that case, you can send USDT from Binance to OKex on the TRC20 network, it's free and fast
1. Buy AVAX on OKex with the received USDT
