# How can I send AVAX from Binance/Okex to Metamask?

Follow this Youtube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNGqS-X4ruM)

Steps:
* Send AVAX to the Web Avalanche Wallet
** AVAX must be withdrawn from Binance on the X-chain address from the Web Avalanche Wallet: This process is slow, it can take from several minutes to several hours before the AVAX tokens are received in the Avalanche Web Wallet
* Inside the Web Avalanche Wallet, cross chain the AVAX from the X-chain to the C-chain
* Send the AVAX from the Web Avalanche Wallet to MetaMask
* On the Zero Exchange, have your wallet connected and switch to the Avalanche chain
* On the swap page, trade AVAX for Zero


Binance has a habit of disabling temporarily the withdrawal of some tokens, like AVAX:
* In that case, you can send USDT from Binance to OKex on the TRC20 network, it's free and fast
* Buy AVAX on OKex with the received USDT
