This page will give you a brief introduction on how to manage liquidity pools. Let's dive in!

## What is a liquidity pool?

[Check this article made by Binance](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-liquidity-pools-in-defi)

## High level principles

* A pool is made of 2 pairs, most of the pools on the Zero Exchange are paired with ZERO  
_Example: ZERO/AVAX, ZERO/zETH, ZERO/zSUSHI_

* You enter a pool by providing paired tokens: ZERO and another token. A pool emits a certain number of ZERO tokens per week between a start and end date: These are the rewards to be shared amongst all liquidity providers of that pool in function of their shares of the pool.

* The benefit of being in a pool (for a pool delivering rewards in ZERO and in the context of the Zero Exchange):
  * Earning rewards in ZERO by farming
  * Earning rewards in ZERO as a percentage of the trades
  * The rewards earned depends on your share of the pool  
   If you are very early in a pool, you could put a small amount and still have huge rewards until more and more people join, then your pool share goes down, and so does your share of the rewards

* Pools are available on the 3 chains

* A pool has a starting and end date : You can stay in the pool after the end date is passed, but you won't earn rewards anymore from the farming, you will still collect rewards from the trading fees.

* When to get out of a liquidity pools?  Up to you ...
  * The longer you stay, the more rewards you earn (depends on your share of the pool of course)
  * See the risk of impermanent loss: Depending on the price action of one the paired token you may chose to exist and re-enter later to optimise your initial stack of ZERO
  * The liquidity pool has ended: Before exiting, please check again the risk of impermanent loss, you may want to time/delay your exit in some circumstances.

* Risk: See impermanent loss

## What are the fees?

* Entering/exiting a liquidity pool involves several steps, same for claiming the rewards: There are transaction fees for each step
* So from cheapest to most expensive to manage liquidity on the 3 chains: Polygon > BSC > Avalanche > Ethereum

Do we avoid the Ethereum chain then?  Not necessarily: Depends where your tokens are (if you need to pay for the bridge costs or not), how much dollar value they represent and/or the share of the pool you would have, it could be worth it.

1. Go to the "Pools" section
1. Activate the checkbox "Staked only"
1. Toggle between "Live"/"Finished" (in case you are still in pools which have ended)
1. Switch chain to check the pools on each chain
