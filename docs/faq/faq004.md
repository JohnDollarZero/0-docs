## Can I buy ZERO on Pancakeswap?

For the time being, it's not advised to buy ZERO on Pancakeswap, even if there is a ZERO token available there (it may have been created by an individual not part of the Zero team), there is no liquidity to make trading possible because there isn't a populated liquidity pool to back it.   

For the ZERO token and the BSC network, it may be confusing, but buying ZERO on Pancakeswap is not the same as buying on the Zero Exchange with the wallet connected to the BSC network.

:::warning
In summary: Buy ZERO on the Zero Exchange, regardless of the chain your wallet is connected to!
