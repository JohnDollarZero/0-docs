## Buying ZERO on Pancakeswap?

For the time being, it's not advised to buy ZERO on Pancakeswap because there is no liquidity for it.

For the ZERO token and the BSC network, it may be confusing, but buying ZERO on Pancakeswap is not the same as buying on the Zero Exchange with the wallet connected to the BSC network.

:::warning
In summary: Buy ZERO on the Zero Exchange, regardless of the chain your wallet is connected to!
