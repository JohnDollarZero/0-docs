## How much are the fees?

There are two kind of fees:
 * Trading fees on a chain: Swapping a token to another token on a same chain, like Uniswap on the Ethereum chain or Pancakeswap on the BSC chain
 * Cross chain fees: When bridging a token from one chain to another chain

### Trading fees

The fees depends on which chain the trade is done: Spuer low on Polygon, very low on BSC, a bit more expensive on Avalanche than on BSC, Ethereum is the most expensive (same fees as Uniswap).

Compared to the Ethereum chain, the trading fees are almost zero on Polygon, BSC and Avalanche.

:::note
When using MetaMask on the Avalanche chain, MetaMask is still calculating fees based on the ETH currency on their user interface, not the AVAX one.  So the actual fee you pay will be much lower than what MetaMask displays.

### Cross chain/bridging fees

Approximate fees (at the time of writing) depends on which chain tokens are bridged from:
* From Polygon to another chain: 1$
* From BSC to another chain: 5$
* From Avax to another chain: 15$
* From Ethereum to another chain: More than 100$
