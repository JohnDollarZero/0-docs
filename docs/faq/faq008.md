# How much are the fees?

There are two kind of fees:
 * Trading fees on a chain: Swapping a token to another token on a same chain, like Uniswap on the Ethereum chain or Pancakeswap on the BSC chain
 * Cross chain fees: When bridging a token from one chain to another chain

## Trading fees

The fees depends on which chain the trade is done: Very low on BSC, a bit more expensive on Avalanche than on BSC, Ethereum is the most expensive (same fees as Uniswap).

Compared to the Ethereum chain, the trading fees are almost zero on BSC and Avalanche.

:::note
When using MetaMask on the Avalanche chain, MetaMask is still calculating fees based on the ETH currency on their user interface, not the AAVX one.  So the actual fee you pay will be much lower than what MetaMask displays.

## Cross chain/bridging fees

Fixed fee of around 2.99 AVAX regardless of the chains being bridged.

_Why that much even when crossing from BSC to Avalanche for example where fees are cheap?  
 For equality reason between bridge users, the bridge costs are spread evenly amongst all bridged chains: Once more chains are integrated, fees will go lower because the costs can be spread between more chains._

On the roadmap: The team will decouple the bridge fees in function of the chains involved in the operation
