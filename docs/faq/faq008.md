# How much are the fees?

## Trading fees

The fees depends on which chain the trade is done: Very low on BSC, a bit more expensive on AVAX than on BSC, ETH is the most expensive (same fees as Uniswap).

Compared to the ETH chain, the trading fees are almost zero on BSC and AVAX.

:::note
When using MetaMask on the Avax chain, MetaMask is still calculating fees based on the ETH currency on their user interface, not the Avax one.  So the actual fee you pay will be much lower than what MetaMask displays.

## Cross chain/bridging fees

Fixed fee of around 2.99 AVAX regardless of the chains being bridged.

_Why so high even when crossing from BSC to AVAX for example where fees are cheap?_

For equality reason between bridge users, the bridge costs are spread evenly amongst all chains bridged: Once more chains are integrated, fees will go lower because the costs can be spread even more.

On the roadmap: The team will decouple the bridge fees in function of the chains involved in the operation
