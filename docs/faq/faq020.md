## Withdrawing from a liquidity pool

[Check this faq](faq009.md) on how to manage your liquidity pools.

### Steps

:::note
For the steps where an action is required in MetaMask (confirming/signing a transaction), the next step may be slow or quick depending on the chain where you are providing liquidity (Ethereum is usually much slower than the other chains), just be patient until the system goes to the next step
:::  

1. Make sure your wallet is connected to the Zero Exchange 
1. Select the chain and then the pool you want to enter.  In our example, we will remove liquidity from the pool ZERO-AVAX on the Avalanche chain

1. Click on the "Select" button after selecting the liquidity pool  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-002.png')} />

1. You will arrive on the ZERO/AVAX liquidity pool management screen.  Click on the "Withdraw From Pool" link  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-003.png')} />

1. System will display the confirmation screen, click on "Withdraw & Claim"
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-004.png')} />

1. A transaction fee is due for the confirmation step: MetaMask will open automatically, click on "Confirm" 
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-005.png')} />

1. A screen is displayed to inform that the transaction is submitted, you can close it anytime:  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-006.png')} />

1. You are back on the ZERO/AVAX liquidity pool management screen.  Depending on the speed of the transaction, you may have a pending transaction information in the B aread of this screen: Once processed, system displays a confirmation message.  The area A shows everything as "0", meaning you are not in the pool anymore   
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-007png')} />

1. At this stage, you withdrew the LP tokens (the underlying pairs are not yet back in your wallet). Now, you can either choose to:
    * Re-enter a newly opened liquidity pool for example with the exact same paired token (in this tutorial, we removed the LP tokens from a finished/closed liquidity pool)
    * Extract and retrieve the paired token from the LP tokens and get them back in your wallet: These are the next step of this FAQ

1. Click on "Pools" on the left side  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-008png')} />

1. Click on "Remove Liquidity" on the right side  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-009png')} />

1. Select the tokens paired in the LP tokens you want to extract/retrieve from the LP tokens  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-010png')} />

1. Once you have both tokens filled in, system will display the LP tokens found not in a liquidity pool for that pair.   Note: It's normal that you see "ZERO:WAVAX" and not "ZERO:AVAX"
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-011png')} />

1. Two input options:
* Enter how much Zero you want to retrieve in field 1 (or click on MAX if you want to retrieve them all)  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-012png')} />
* Toggle to the % view on clicking on "Simple", you will get an alternate input: You can slide the % (or click on fixed % value) of the LP tokens you want to retrieve the paired tokens of  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-013png')} />

1. Once you have filled what you want to retrieve, click on the "Approve" button  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-014png')} />

1. A transaction fee is due for the approval step: MetaMask will open automatically, click on "Sign" 
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-015.png')} />

1. Once the "Approve" button turns to green (you may have to wait a bit if the network is slow, just be wait), click on the "Remove" button  
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-016.png')} />

1. System will display the confirmation screen, click on "Confirm"
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-017.png')} />

1. A transaction fee is due for the removal step: MetaMask will open automatically, click on "Confirm" 
<img alt="Select liquidity pool" src={useBaseUrl('/img/faq020-018.png')} />

1. When the confirmation transaction fee is successful, you will get the following screen. Both paired tokens are added in your wallet.
