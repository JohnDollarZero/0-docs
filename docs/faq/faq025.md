## How to add a new chain in MetaMask

The Ethereum chain is configured by default in MetaMask, but you would like to trade on/cross chain to other chains.

On the Zero Exchange, simply switch from chain: If it's detected that the chain is not configured in MetaMask, just follow the instructions, super easy!  


1. In our example, we initiated a cross chain to a chain which was not yet configured in MetaMask, from BSC to Polygon

1. Approve the request by MetaMask to add the new network/chain

1. Accept the request by MetaMask to switch network/chain

1. The Zero Exchanges switches to the new chain (Polygon in our example)
