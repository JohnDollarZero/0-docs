## How to cross chain

Regarding cross chain fees, [please check this page](../zerobridge.md).  
Check the [official guide for the gas settings](https://0-exchange.gitbook.io/0-exchange-docs/pinned/transaction-fails). 

:::tip
Make sure you have enough token for the gas fee on the current chain you are sending tokens from!
:::

:::tip
If a transaction seems to be pending, try to reset your MetaMask account and/or clear cache/cookies of your browser
:::

:::note
If a transaction doesn't go through after it seemed to be successful, contact an admin/mod in the main Telegram chat

1. Switch to the network where you want to cross from, "Smartchain" (= BSC) in our example, and click on "Transfer" (the cross chain fee is already displayed, make sure you have enough token for the fees, like BNB in our example)
