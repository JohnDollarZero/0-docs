## How to cross chain?

Regarding cross chain fees, [please check this page](../zerobridge.md).

### Steps

:::note
Make sure you have enough token for the gas fee on the current chain you are sending tokens from!
:::

1. Make sure your wallet is connected to the Zero Exchange 

1. Switch to the network where you want to cross from, "Smartchain" (= BSC) in our example, and click on "Transfer" (the cross chain fee is already displayed, make sure you have enough token for the cost, like BNB in our example)
