# Tokens traded on the Zero Exchange can be traded on other exchanges as well?

:::important
It depends on which chain and/or which token.
:::

On the Ethereum chain:
* Yes for all tokens. When trading on the ETH chain, you replace Uniswap (or other DEXes) by the Zero Exchange instead. If you don't find your token natively listed under the Zero drop down menu just go to etherscan or bscscan and find the contract address of the coin you would like to swap and add it to the Zero interface.


On the Avalanche chain:
* The native Avax token can be traded on any exchanges on the Avax chain
* There is a partnership with Gondola Finance, which will allow in the future to swap some tokens between exchanges on the Avax chain.  

Once this partnership is live on Zero Exchange, it would prevent you from having to zUSDT to Avax on the Zero Exchange and then go to Pangolin and sell the Avax to their USDT token. Zero's site would just swap it for you by routing it through Gondola.


On the BSC chain:
* Same story as for Avax chain
* Gondola Finance is for the moment only existing on the Avalanche chain
* The native BNB token can be traded on any exchanges on the BSC chain (like Pancakeswap for example)
