## Tokens traded on the Zero Exchange can be traded on other exchanges as well?

:::important
It depends on which chain and/or which token.
:::

On the Ethereum chain:
* Yes for all tokens. When trading on the Ethereum chain, you replace Uniswap (or other DEXes) by the Zero Exchange instead. If you don't find your token natively listed under the Zero drop down menu just go to etherscan or bscscan and find the contract address of the coin you would like to swap and add it to the Zero interface.


On the Avalanche chain:
* The native AVAX token can be traded on any exchanges on the Avalanche chain
* For wrapped tokens, no: You can only trade the tokens supported by the Zero Exchange
  * There is a partnership with [Gondola Finance](https://gondola.finance), which allows to swap some specific wrapped tokens between exchanges on the Avalanche chain (done on the Gondola Finance website)
  * [Check this FAQ](faq005.md) over wrapped tokens explanations  


On the BSC chain:
* Same story as for the Avalanche chain, except BNB and BUSD are the native tokens and can be traded on any exchanges on the BSC chain (like Pancakeswap for example)
* Gondola Finance is for the moment only existing on the Avalanche chain


###I want to trade a token existing on two chains not supported by the Zero Exchange, how can I cross chain it?
