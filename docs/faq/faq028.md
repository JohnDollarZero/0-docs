## Role of relayers in the bridge

This is an exact copy/paste of an explanation of the team lead on Telegram:

"when tokens cross the bridge they are not burned, they are locked on contract, the asset is then minted as a wrapped token on the destination chain. when the trader goes back in the other direction the wrapped token is burned and the token that was locked is released 1:1 back to the user"
