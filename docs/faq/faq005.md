# Why are some of the tokens on BSC and Avax named "zXXX"?

The Zero Exchange "wraps" some of the tokens when they are bridged from their "native" chain to another chain.  Once they are bridged back on their "native" chain, they exist again in their original state and are not wrapped anymore. As an example if you are on the ethereum chain and you use the cross chain bridge to move some ETH to the Avax network when you see it inside your wallet on Avax it will be labelled as zETH.

On some other DEXes, like on Pagolin for example, you can see "USDT" displayed on the interface and not a wrapped version of USDT: Under the hood, they are wrapped it would be more appropriately labelled as pETH, but these DEXes have chosen to not display it to the user as a wrapped token.   On the Zero exchange, it's the WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") principle for full transparency.

If you do find yourself with some tokens on AVAX that have been wrapped by Pagolin you can use a project like [Gondola Finance](https://gondola.finance) to exchange your pETH for zETH for example.

:::tip
For the Zero token, you don't see "zZero" on the different chains, because it's native on all the chains that the Exchange supports.
