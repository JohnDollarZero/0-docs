# Why are some of the tokens on BSC and Avax named "z-XXX"?

The Zero Exchange "wraps" some of the tokens when they are bridged from their "native" chain to another chain.  Once they are bridged back on their "native" chain, they exist again in their original state and are not wrapped anymore.

On some other DEXes, like on Avalanche for example, you can see "USDT" displayed on the interface and not a wrapped version of USDT: Under the hood, they are wrapped, but these DEXes have chosen to not display it to the user as a wrapped token.   On the Zero exchange, it's the WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") principle for full transparency.

For the Zero token, you don't see "z-Zero" on the different chains, because it's native on all the chains that the Exchange supports.
