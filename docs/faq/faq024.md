## How to send MATIC to MetaMask

### Get free MATIC

At the time of writing, you can receive 0.001 MATIC (enough for several transactions) on the Polygon network when you connect your MetaMask wallet to this website [https://matic.supply/](https://matic.supply/)  
And on the Zero Exchange afterwards, swap some ZERO for MATIC if you want to have a bit more in reserve.


### Buy MATIC on a CEX
1. Binance:
	1. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en)
	1. [Binance US](https://www.binance.us/en/home)
1. [Ascendex](https://ascendex.com/en/register?inviteCode=N8NYPBU3)

For the withdrawal from these CEX, there is an option to withdraw directly to the Polygon network configured in MetaMask.  
Although as usual, Binance may temporarily disable the withdrawal.  In that case, send USDT from Binance to Ascendex via the TRC-20 network (free and fast).
