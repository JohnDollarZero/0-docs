# Getting started

First of all if this is your first APE into the world of crypto welcome! Before you YETH all your coins at the
market we are going to take you through a few steps so that your attempt to make your wife's boyfriend jealous
is successful and you can enjoy copious amounts of coins of your own.

:::important
Gas fees from hell, front running, and juicy liquidity. The ethereum network is not a place for plebs
:::

1. Please leave your feelings at the door. The ETH network is a viscious place that eats noobs.
1. Add the tokens you want to hold so MetaMask is ready and you're able to see the coins' balances. 


## Addresses

Often when you end up on a new chain you are missing the addresses for the additional tokens that you hold in 
your wallet. This can lead to confusion and thinking that you are missing coins. After you do your RPC 
additions to get the chain interacting with your meta mask you also need to add your asset by its address on the new chain. 
The reason for this is DeFI is so new that MetaMask has yet to release a version that contains chains other than Ethereum.
You can add any of the addresses below as custom tokens inside your MetaMask on the Ethereum network. Since Ethereum was 
the original DeFI chain it is already built into MetaMask and doesn't require an addition to work. One thing you might be 
missing though inside your MM is the ZERO token so why don't we try and add it. Go to assests -> Add token -> Custom Token
and input the Zero address listed below. It should find the symbol after you paste it in there and compare it against the 
table below. Keep in mind here that each smart contract that is deployed has a contract address and each ERC20 token that 
you are adding to your wallet needs to be identified by it's original smart contract address to be genuine. 

:::important
Scammers are out there minting tokens that have the same names and same supply but only one will have the valid contract address.

## Cross-chain Transfers

:::warning
Reset your MetaMask wallet EACH TIME you switch between ETH and Avalanche network, unless you use the two browser workaround.
::: 

:::important
Change Gas Price (GWEI) to 20-30 higher than whatever [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) shows for "High" and change 
Gas Limit to 350000
:::

:::warning
FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY RESULT IN A FAILED TRANSACTION COSTING YOU A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GAS.
