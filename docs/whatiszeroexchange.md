## What is the Zero Exchange

The Zero Exchange is at its core a multi and cross chain decentralized exchange.  Its ethos is to fully embrace the decentralized aspects of crypto and to grow a thriving and engaged community, backed by a dedicated project team identifying the opportunities (features, technical, partnerships, etc) to build as a 1st mover a model for the future of crypto trading on multiple chains in a one stop shop, except that the future is now.


### Official statement from the white paper

> ZERO Exchange is a fully decentralised protocol for automated liquidity provision.
> 
> The ZERO Exchange Protocol realigns incentives for network participants by introducing revenue sharing and community driven network effects to the popular AMM model.

### Chains currently connected

* Avalanche
* BSC
* Polygon (Matic)

	* If you hold enough ZERO or CHART tokens in your wallet, you can already use the [charts on ChartEX website](https://metamorphosis.chartex.pro)
	* Check in the [Zero partnerships page](partnerships.md) ("ChartEx2") the requirements to be able to use ChartEx
* Offers a possibility to transfer tokens from one chain to another even if the Zero Exchange wouldn't support these or there is no liquidity on the Zero Exchange

### Go live

Exchange was launched at the end of January 2021.

#### Some achievements of the project so far
Being the first project to:
* Build a bridge between the Ethereum and Avalanche chains
* Build a bridge between the Avalanche and BSC chains
* Build a bridge to Kusama/DOT parachains in partnership with Moonbeam
	* The Zero Exchange will likely the first DEX to be ready and operational on these parachains
* Integrate ChartEx
