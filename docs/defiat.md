## Getting started

Defiat is a platform that provides single sided staking for Zero. That means you stake your Zero on their platform and earn rewards in their DFT Token.

To get started on DEFIAT you are going to need a few tools and links. 

1. Go to [defiat.net](https://defiat.net) and connect up your wallet on the ETH chain
1. Navigate to the [Zero Pool for staking](https://defiat.net/staking/18)
1. Click the Stake/Unstake Button add the amount of Zero you want to stake and sign the transaction to allow Defiat to transaction with Zero in your wallet. This first transaction should cost about $10-$15 and will take 3-7 mins to complete so be patient.
1. Once your approved transaction has completed and been accepted in a block on the eth network you can complete your stake. Metamask will prompt you again for a second transaction and this time it will be in the $60-75 range and you must confirm it.
1. When your second transaction completes you will see a green box at the bottom of the screen that shows completed and your stake will be visible on the main page.
1. When exiting the pool afer you sign the exit transaction it can take up to 15 mins depending on gas you used to see the coins in your wallet. You will get the coins back from your stake plus your DFT rewards in DFT so make sure you add this token to your wallet.
